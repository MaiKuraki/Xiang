# Providers and integrations

[English | 简体中文](Providers.SCH.md)

AssetManagement ships three providers (Resources, Addressables, YooAsset) and two integrations (Navigathena, VContainer). Provider-neutral consumers depend on `IAssetPackage`; only composition and release-operation assemblies reference a provider assembly.

## Overview

Each provider is exposed as an `IAssetModule` with a distinct capability surface. Addressables and YooAsset cannot be active through these adapters simultaneously — the framework AssetBundle runtime guard establishes one provider authority until coexistence, shutdown ordering, and memory behavior are qualified as a complete product configuration.

### Key Features

- **Resources**: always available, bootstrap-friendly, loading-only.
- **Addressables**: catalog maintenance, Tags/Locations downloaders, scene loading, bulk loading.
- **YooAsset**: manifest activation, All/Tags/Locations downloaders, raw-file access, scene loading, bulk loading.
- **Navigathena**: explicit scene navigation built on `IAssetSceneLoader`.
- **VContainer**: DI installer for module and retention scheduler.

### Choose a provider

| Requirement | Resources | Addressables | YooAsset |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Async asset load and prefab instance | yes | yes | yes |
| Synchronous asset load | yes | no | yes |
| Bulk/sub-asset load | no | yes | yes |
| Raw-file access | no | no | yes |
| Async scene load | no | yes | yes |
| Remote downloader | no | Tags, Locations | All, Tags, Locations |
| Provider maintenance | no | latest catalog, unused-bundle cleanup, global Unity cache | product-version manifest activation, package cache |
| Reliable built-in storage probe | no | desktop/Editor cache volume only | specific desktop/Editor Host configuration |
| Provider runtime ownership | one owner per module | one process owner, one logical package | one process owner, multiple packages |

For example, UIFramework's dynamic-atlas sample requires `IAssetSyncOperations`, DataTable raw loading requires `IAssetRawFileLoader`, and Navigathena requires `IAssetSceneLoader`.

### Optional assembly activation

An optional assembly becomes eligible for compilation when its dependency is installed in `UnityStarter/Packages/manifest.json` and resolved in `packages-lock.json`, its version satisfies the asmdef `versionDefines` range, and every `defineConstraints` entry is satisfied. These assemblies use `autoReferenced: false`, so a consumer asmdef must reference the selected provider or integration assembly; that reference does not control whether the optional assembly itself is compiled.

| Assembly | Supported version condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CycloneGames.AssetManagement.Runtime.Providers.Addressables` | `com.unity.addressables` `[2.11.1,2.11.2)` |
| `CycloneGames.AssetManagement.Runtime.Providers.YooAsset` | `com.tuyoogame.yooasset` `[3.0.5,4.0.0)` |
| `CycloneGames.AssetManagement.Runtime.Integrations.Navigathena` | `com.mackysoft.navigathena` `[1.1.0,1.1.1)` |
| `CycloneGames.AssetManagement.Runtime.Integrations.VContainer` | installed `jp.hadashikick.vcontainer` |

Never add generated `CYCLONEGAMES_HAS_*` symbols manually in Player Settings.

## Core Concepts

### Runtime-location contract

`AssetRef`, `SceneRef`, and load methods use an exact provider runtime key. An Editor asset path is not a provider-neutral address.

| Provider | Example asset in project | Runtime location example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resources | `Assets/Game/Resources/UI/Inventory.png` | `UI/Inventory` |
| Addressables | any addressable entry | the configured Addressables address |
| YooAsset | collected asset | the configured YooAsset address |

The property drawer stores an Editor GUID to display the authoring object and exposes `Runtime Location` as a separate field. Selecting another object clears the previous runtime location. The validator reports missing GUID targets and empty locations but never rewrites a custom provider key.

### Scene provider contract

Addressables and YooAsset expose only the asynchronous `IAssetSceneLoader` capability. The advanced overload carries Unity `LoadSceneParameters` and supports `LocalPhysicsMode.None`, `Physics2D`, `Physics3D`, and the valid `Physics2D | Physics3D` combination. The loaded scene owns those local physics worlds and destroys them during unload.

Each package owns an active-scene registry and a private origin token. Active unload validates the exact handle and registry entry. After a successful unload, `LoadSceneMode.Single` replacement, or external `SceneManager` unload, a repeated unload through the same package generation is a terminal no-op; another package or a recreated generation is rejected.

Activation and unload are main-thread-affine single-flight transitions. Cancellation is accepted only before the first provider mutation. Once unload starts, later calls join it even with a cancelled token. A failed unload leaves the handle registered, removes the diagnostic `Unloading` state, records the lifecycle error, and permits a new attempt.

Scenes are not asset-cache entries: SLRU admission, cache trim, bucket clear, and low-memory cache maintenance do not unload them. `ISceneHandle.Dispose` is idempotent caller-wrapper release only. The originating package remains the unload authority until terminal unload or package shutdown.

## Usage Guide

### Resources ownership composition

Resources is always available. Keep the module in an application owner; returning only the package loses shutdown authority.

```csharp
public sealed class ResourcesAssetOwner
{
    private IAssetModule _module;

    public IAssetPackage Package { get; private set; }

    public async UniTask InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _module = new ResourcesModule();
        try
        {
            Package = await AssetManager.InitializeDefaultPackageAsync(
                _module, "BuiltIn",
                new AssetManagementOptions(), new AssetPackageInitOptions(),
                cancellationToken);
        }
        catch
        {
            await _module.DestroyAsync();
            throw;
        }
    }

    public async UniTask ShutdownAsync()
    {
        if (_module == null) return;
        await _module.DestroyAsync();
        Package = null;
        _module = null;
    }
}
```

Resources exposes async and sync single-asset loading, runtime diagnostics, and the optional `IUnityUnusedAssetCollector` capability. It does not expose bulk, raw-file, scene, catalog, downloader, storage-preflight, or provider-maintenance capabilities. Releasing a handle releases AssetManagement ownership, but Unity may retain native Resources data. Schedule the process-wide collection only at a measured phase boundary:

```csharp
if (package is IUnityUnusedAssetCollector collector)
{
    await collector.CollectUnusedUnityAssetsAsync();
}
```

The call clears idle framework ownership, joins concurrent requests, and awaits Unity's global unused-resource pass. Package shutdown joins an in-flight pass. Keep an AssetManagement lease alive for every asset that must remain owned; a bare managed stack reference is not an ownership guarantee during this Unity operation.

### Addressables composition

The Addressables provider targets `com.unity.addressables` `[2.11.1,2.11.2)`. Install a compatible package and reference the provider assembly from the composition assembly.

```csharp
IAssetModule module = new AddressablesModule();

IAssetPackage package = await AssetManager.InitializeDefaultPackageAsync(
    module, "Default",
    new AssetManagementOptions(),
    new AssetPackageInitOptions(providerOptions: null),
    cancellationToken);
```

The adapter enforces one AssetManagement Addressables owner and one logical package. Module initialization and package initialization are separate gates; `ProviderOptions` must be null. Addressables Groups, Profiles, remote paths, and Player content must already be built by the product pipeline.

The product pipeline writes `AddressablesVersion.json` into `Addressables.BuildPath`. Addressables' official Player processor maps that directory directly to `StreamingAssets/aa`, so the adapter reads only `StreamingAssets/aa/AddressablesVersion.json`. The provider does not probe alternative or historical layouts.

```csharp
if (package is not IAddressablesCatalogMaintenance maintenance)
{
    throw new System.NotSupportedException("Addressables maintenance is unavailable.");
}

bool updated = await maintenance.UpdateLatestCatalogsAsync(cancellationToken);
bool cleaned = await maintenance.CleanUnusedBundleCacheAsync(cancellationToken);
```

Catalog and cache mutations fail fast when another mutation is active on the same package. Once catalog check starts, caller cancellation is observed only after the provider reaches a safe terminal boundary and before activation begins. A catalog attempt advances wrapper cache generation even after provider failure. Idle entries are disposed; active handles remain valid and counted Active but become generation-detached from keyed SLRU lookup until final release or shutdown.

`CleanUnusedBundleCacheAsync` is the normal maintenance operation. `ClearAllCacheFilesAsync` calls Unity's process-wide `Caching.ClearCache`; it is destructive, not scoped to the logical package. `ReadReleaseMetadataVersionAsync` reads bounded product metadata for correlation; it is not authenticated authorization or anti-rollback evidence.

Addressables Tags/Locations downloaders use provider-global scheduling; per-downloader concurrency and retry are not exposed. A key array accepts 1-65,536 values, up to 4,096 characters each and 8 Mi characters total. Each package retains at most 128 registered downloader wrappers and 262,144 explicit scope values. Addressables cannot abort an in-flight `DownloadDependenciesAsync`; `Cancel`/`Dispose` cancels every joined caller-visible wait while the adapter retains the pending handle, drains it to terminal, records its final snapshot, and releases the provider handle exactly once. `CurrentDownloadBytes` caches provider status and refreshes at most four times per second. All downloader status properties are main-thread-affine.

Addressables decrements an operation's provider reference count before provider destruction finishes. If `Addressables.Release` throws after that mutation may have started, the adapter marks the release outcome indeterminate, retains the handle and diagnostic, and never reissues the same release request. Package shutdown remains failed on every retry instead of risking a second decrement or reporting false success. Treat that package generation as terminally unhealthy and preserve the exception for the product's outer recovery or process-restart policy.

Pending Addressables operations reject `WaitForAsyncComplete` on every platform. Await `Task`.

### YooAsset composition

The YooAsset provider targets stable `com.tuyoogame.yooasset` releases in `[3.0.5,4.0.0)`. The asmdef range is the compilation envelope; SemVer prereleases sort before their final release, so a prerelease inside that envelope can enter compilation, but the activation test rejects it as unsupported. `YooAssetModule` exclusively owns the process-global Yoo runtime. Each client instance that requires an isolated writable cache must pass a distinct explicit `PackageRoot` through its file-system parameters.

Pending asset, all-assets, raw-file, instance, and scene operations reject `WaitForAsyncComplete` with `NotSupportedException`. Await the wrapper `Task`; a terminal synchronous-wait call is a no-op. This replaces the prior YooAsset behavior that asked the provider to advance a pending operation synchronously; `IAssetSyncOperations` is a separate capability and is unchanged.

```csharp
using YooAsset;

var module = new YooAssetModule(asyncOperationMaxTimeSliceMs: 16L);
await module.InitializeAsync(new AssetManagementOptions());

IAssetPackage package = module.CreatePackage("DefaultPackage");
var options = new OfflinePlayModeOptions
{
    BuiltinFileSystemParameters =
        FileSystemParameters.CreateDefaultBuiltinFileSystemParameters(),
    BundleLoadingMaxConcurrency = 4,
};

bool initialized = await package.InitializeAsync(
    new AssetPackageInitOptions(providerOptions: options),
    cancellationToken);
```

Create a fresh `InitializePackageOptions` subtype for each package. The adapter accepts `BundleLoadingMaxConcurrency` 1-64; `int.MaxValue` selects the platform fallback.

| Mode | Required product-owned options |
| --- | --- |
| EditorSimulate | `EditorSimulateModeOptions` and Editor file-system parameters for the simulated package root |
| Offline | `OfflinePlayModeOptions` and built-in file-system parameters |
| Host | `HostPlayModeOptions`, built-in/cache file-system parameters, and an `IRemoteService` owned by the product |
| Web | `WebPlayModeOptions` and web-server and/or web-network file-system parameters |
| Custom | `CustomPlayModeOptions` with an ordered product-owned file-system parameter list |

`asyncOperationMaxTimeSliceMs` accepts 10-100 ms. It controls Yoo's main-thread asynchronous-operation budget, not network concurrency. The default 16 ms is not a 60/120 fps guarantee.

`IYooAssetPackageMaintenance` accepts a product-supplied version for typed manifest loading and exposes `UnloadUnusedProviderAssetsAsync`, typed cache cleanup, and All/Tags/Locations downloaders. The unload-unused call clears idle framework ownership and runs YooAsset's package-local operation; it is not Unity's process-wide Resources pass. Package names and manifest versions are ASCII tokens, 1-128 characters with path-safe rules. Downloader concurrency is 1-32, retry count 0-16, and maintenance timeouts 1-3,600 seconds. Tag/location arrays use the same bounds as Addressables. Downloader `Cancel`/`Dispose` cancels every joined caller-visible wait, requests provider-native `CancelDownload`, and keeps the wrapper registered until it observes provider terminal state.

Desktop/Editor storage preflight is reliable only for Host mode using the default sandbox cache file system with a non-empty explicit `PackageRoot`. Other modes, custom file systems, implicit roots, mobile, WebGL, and consoles report `Unknown`.

Raw content is loaded as `RawFileObject`. The adapter snapshots its text and bytes on the Unity main thread before the operation publishes success. Completed `ReadText` and `ReadBytes` calls are then worker-safe; every `ReadBytes` call returns a new defensive copy. `FilePath` remains empty because a provider bundle/archive path is not a portable raw-file path.

Use `WebServerFileSystem` and/or `WebNetworkFileSystem` through `WebPlayModeOptions` on WebGL; `SandboxFileSystem` is not supported there. The provider `link.xml` preserves YooAsset's built-in reflected file-system implementations.

### Capability negotiation in consumers

```csharp
if (package is IAssetBulkLoader bulkLoader)
{
    using IAllAssetsHandle<UnityEngine.Sprite> handle =
        bulkLoader.LoadAllAssetsAsync<UnityEngine.Sprite>("UI/Icons");
    await handle.Task;
    UseSprites(handle.Assets);
}

if (package is IAssetRawFileLoader rawLoader)
{
    using IRawFileHandle raw = rawLoader.LoadRawFileAsync(
        "Config/Balance.bytes", cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
    await raw.Task;
    byte[] bytes = raw.ReadBytes();
    if (bytes == null) throw new System.IO.IOException(raw.Error);
}
```

Resources and Addressables do not implement `IAssetRawFileLoader`; a product needing portable data loading can author a `TextAsset` path through the normal asset contract.

## Advanced Topics

### VContainer

`AssetManagementVContainerInstaller` registers `IAssetModule`, starts module initialization through `IAsyncStartable`, and can register the retention scheduler. It does not create a package and cannot await module shutdown from synchronous scope disposal.

```csharp
var installer = new AssetManagementVContainerInstaller(
    moduleFactory: _ => new ResourcesModule(),
    options: new AssetManagementOptions(),
    cacheRetentionOptions: default,
    packageResolver: null);

installer.Install(builder);
```

VContainer cancellation is checked before provider-global initialization begins; it cannot interrupt initialization already in progress. Create and initialize packages separately. Before disposing the owning `LifetimeScope`, explicitly await `module.DestroyAsync()` and handle failure.

### Navigathena

Navigathena requires an explicit scene capability:

```csharp
IAssetSceneLoader sceneLoader = package as IAssetSceneLoader ??
    throw new System.NotSupportedException("The selected provider has no scene capability.");

var loadParameters = new UnityEngine.SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters(
    UnityEngine.SceneManagement.LoadSceneMode.Additive)
{
    localPhysicsMode = UnityEngine.SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.Physics2D
};

var identifier = sceneRef.ToSceneIdentifier(
    sceneLoader, loadParameters, SceneActivationMode.ActivateOnLoad,
    bucket: "Gameplay.Scene");
```

`CreateHandle` is lazy and does not acquire a provider scene. The first `Load` performs a cancellation precheck, acquires the provider handle, and starts authoritative cleanup if load or activation fails before ownership is handed back. Repeated `Load` calls fail fast; repeated or concurrent `Unload` calls join one retryable operation. The integration rejects `LoadSceneMode.Single` and undefined modes at construction; only additive loading is accepted. To transfer an already-started additive handle, call `NavigathenaSceneHandleAdapter.TakeOwnership(handle, owningLoader, LoadSceneMode.Additive)` and stop using the previous caller lease immediately.

Navigathena 1.1.0 `StandardSceneNavigator` does not clean up the target handle when cancellation, blank-scene unloading, or entry-point discovery fails after `ISceneHandle.Load` returns but before `SceneState` takes ownership; its synchronous disposal also does not await an active transition or unload the current scene. It is therefore not supported for production provider-backed scenes, including additive scenes. Production use requires a fixed upstream/fork or a custom navigator that closes both the post-load ownership handoff and asynchronous teardown boundaries. Do not combine Navigathena's native Addressables identifier with the CycloneGames provider owner for the same scene.

### Custom provider boundary

A custom provider belongs in a separate assembly that references the core runtime. Keep SDK types out of provider-neutral public contracts. A production adapter must define and test: one owner for module, package, provider handles, instances, scenes, and downloaders; main-thread affinity and any narrow worker-safe operation; memoized multi-await completion and provider-fault propagation; caller cancellation versus shared caller-visible cancellation, physical-abort capability, pending-operation ownership, and terminal release; cache key generation and invalidation after content mutation; deterministic shutdown, leak containment, and retryable versus terminal failure; and platform, IL2CPP/AOT, stripping, WebGL, filesystem, and suspend/resume behavior.

Do not add a capability to `IAssetPackage` unless all providers can implement the same semantics. Provider-specific maintenance remains in the provider assembly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider assembly not compiling | Dependency missing or version out of range | Install and lock a supported stable SDK version; confirm `versionDefines` and reference the assembly from the composition asmdef |
| Addressables `ProviderOptions` rejected | Non-null options passed | `ProviderOptions` must be null for Addressables |
| YooAsset package initialization fails | Wrong `InitializePackageOptions` subtype | Construct the exact subtype for the selected play mode and pass it through `AssetPackageInitOptions.ProviderOptions` |
| Addressables catalog update split authority | Direct `Addressables.UpdateCatalogs` call | Route every catalog mutation through the owning package adapter |
| Downloader concurrency not effective | Provider-global scheduling | Addressables: concurrency is provider-managed; YooAsset: explicit 1-32 per downloader, but multiple downloaders and on-demand I/O add together |
| `WaitForAsyncComplete` throws | Pending Addressables or YooAsset operation | Await `Task` instead |
| YooAsset raw `FilePath` empty | By design | `FilePath` is intentionally empty; await `Task` and use `ReadText`/`ReadBytes` |
| Scene unload rejected | Different package or recreated generation | Use the originating package generation; a recreated generation is rejected |
| VContainer shutdown does not await | Scope disposal is synchronous | Explicitly await `module.DestroyAsync()` before disposing the `LifetimeScope` |

## Provider validation checklist

For every claimed provider/platform combination:

1. Lock the exact SDK version and confirm the conditional assembly is active.
2. Compile the provider and its consumer composition asmdef.
3. Validate success, fault, cancellation, repeated await, disposal, main-thread rejection for every status read, cross-package rejection, and shutdown. For YooAsset asset, all-assets, raw-file, instance, and scene wrappers, confirm pending synchronous waits throw without invoking provider wait APIs, all terminal statuses are no-ops, and disposal/late completion/source release stay exactly-once. For Scene, cover `None`/`Physics2D`/`Physics3D` worlds, invalid enums, repeated/concurrent activation and unload, cancellation before mutation and join after commit, failed-load/unload recovery, Single/external unload, and exactly-once provider release.
4. Exercise a clean Player cache and content build, not only Editor simulation.
5. Test Mono and IL2CPP, stripping, domain reload disabled, network loss, storage full, low memory, suspend/resume, and process termination.
6. Record workload, device, content build, and raw performance evidence; do not generalize an Editor result to other platforms.
